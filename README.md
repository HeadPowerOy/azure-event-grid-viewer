# Azure Event Grid Viewer

### HeadPower flavored fork

Adds following to the original implementation https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-event-grid-viewer

- Play/pause function. Now you can decide when enough is enough.
- Filter events by name/subject. You can finally ignore those pesky extra events that flood the logs!
